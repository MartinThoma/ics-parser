## Requirements

  * PHP



## Installation

  * Copy all files to a folder where PHP can be executed
  * Include class.iCalReader.php to your project

## Credits

## Basic Usage ##
The ics-Parser should only provide a very basic object to work with:

```
require 'class.iCalReader.php';

$ical = new ical('MyCal.ics');
print_r($ical->events());
```

## What does $ical->events() return? ##
```
Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [DTSTART] => 20110105T090000Z
            [DTEND] => 20110107T173000Z

## How do I get a Unix timestamp out of a ical date? ##
If the date is before 1970, it returns false.

```
<?
require 'class.iCalReader.php';

$ical = new ical('MyCal.ics');
$array= $ical->events();

// The ical date
$date = $array[0]['DTSTART'];
echo $date;

// The Unix timestamp
echo $ical->iCalDateToUnixTimestamp($date);

?>
```

## How many events / todos are in the iCal? ##
```
<?
require 'class.iCalReader.php';

$ical = new ical('MyCal.ics');

// The number of events
echo $ical->event_count;

// The number of events
echo $ical->todo_count;

?>
```
